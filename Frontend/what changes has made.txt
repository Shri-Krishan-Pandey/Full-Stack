Created a users array to store user credentials (username and password) temporarily in memory.
Updated the Signup component to push new user credentials into the users array.
Removed alert() method and used setSuccess() method.
In the Signup component, added a check to ensure the username is not already taken by searching the users array.
Displayed an error message if the username already exists.
Modified the Signin component to validate entered credentials against the users array.
If a match is found, the user is authenticated (a dummy token is stored in localStorage).
If no match is found, an error message is displayed.
The user is redirected to the dashboard.
Some more UI part improved like placeholder changed, label added for input tags etcs.
